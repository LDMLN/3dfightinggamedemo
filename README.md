A one-on-one 3D fighting game demo built in **Godot 4** using **C#**, inspired by classic fighting games like **Tekken**, **Soul Calibur**, and **Street Fighter**.

## Team

- Luiz Leao III  
- Leela Townsley  
- Donald Reniff  

## About the Project

This project was developed as part of our Capstone course to learn and explore core concepts of fighting game design and 3D game development. Our goal was to build a functional tech demo incorporating genre staples such as:

- Enemy-relative 3D movement (perma-lock-on)
- Input buffering and command list support
- Numpad notation for special move inputs
- Basic UI and health system
- Basic AI opponent behavior
- Local multiplayer mode (keyboard + controller)
- Custom animation setup via Godot's AnimationTree

## Features

- **Single-player mode** vs. basic AI
- **Local two-player mode** with keyboard/controller support
- **Input buffer** system with support for directional and special commands
- **Fireball attack** and dashing

## Tech & Tools Used

- **Engine**: Godot 4
- **Language**: C#
- **Animations**: [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/)
- **Version Control**: Git
